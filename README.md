# Studio Workflows
This repository contains structured workflows, setup notes, and best practices for studio recording, mixing, mastering, and audio production.  
It is designed to document practical processes, improve efficiency, and maintain consistency in professional studio environments.

## Recording Workflow

### Session Preparation
- Organize session in DAW with clear track names and color coding
- Set sample rate and bit depth according to project requirements
- Check preamps, audio interfaces, and monitoring system
- Prepare reference tracks if needed

### Recording
- Position microphones for optimal sound capture
- Monitor levels and gain staging throughout recording
- Record multiple takes and note the best performances
- Document session settings for future reference

### Post-Recording

### Troubleshooting & Best Practices
- Check mono compatibility
- Take breaks to avoid ear fatigue
- Document plugin settings and workflow choices

## Mastering Workflow

- Prepare final mix with proper headroom
- Apply subtle EQ adjustments for clarity
- Use limiting and compression to achieve target loudness
- Check mix on multiple playback systems
- Export in required formats with proper metadata
